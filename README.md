# Social Media Content Analysis 

## Overview
In this project, I served as a Data Analyst at Accenture, assisting a social media company. The brief indicated that the client sought help managing their journey into a large-scale IPO, auditing their big data practice, and analyzing popular content on their platform.

## Situation
The client, a social media company, was preparing for an IPO and needed to understand their data practices better and identify the most popular content on their platform. As a Data Analyst, my role was to audit their big data practice, provide recommendations for the IPO, and analyze the content to find the top-performing categories.

## Task
I was tasked with:
1. Auditing the big data practice of the company.
2. Providing recommendations for the IPO.
3. Analyzing the popular content on the social media platform to identify the top 5 types of content.

## Action
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Received seven datasets and a data model from the client, which illustrated the relationships between the datasets.
   - Identified three essential datasets based on the client's brief and the provided data model.
   - Cleaned the data using Excel by removing missing values, changing the data type of some values within a column, and removing irrelevant columns.

2. **Data Merging**:
   - Created a final dataset by merging the three necessary tables using the “VLOOKUP” formula in Excel.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Determined the top 5 performing categories by summing the total scores for each category using the “SUMIF” formula.
   - Analyzed the content to identify the most popular categories and the month with the highest user activity.

## Result
- **Top 5 Most Popular Content Categories**: 
  - Animals
  - Science
  - Healthy Eating
  - Technology
  - Food

- **Key Insights**:
  - The "Animals" category alone had 1897 reactions, making it the most popular.
  - January was the month with the highest user activity, aligning with the seasonal trend of users reconnecting after calendar events like Christmas.

- **Visualization**:
  - Visualized the analysis results using Excel, which helped the client understand the popularity distribution of different content types.
